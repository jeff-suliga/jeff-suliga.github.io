Someone help!
It seems someone **(not** qualified has been searching through
our characters and **left** A Star-Crossed Information
Interference in**side** that corrupted our transmission and took our **number** - all
of our 1's **and** **zero** s have been wiped! The horr**or** ! We might as 
well have tossed it all into the /bin on the right
and started over from **zerox**, this time making sure our
expressions stay**59** regular.


With regex chars:
