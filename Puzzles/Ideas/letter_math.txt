Do one of those "Letter Adding" puzzles where each letter will be a specific number.

Then make the numbers be like 0-5 and, when put in order they spell a word.

Make the numbers be 0-9, and the letters below those numbers on a keyboard form the answer.
Where the sum in the puzzle has the letters 'ANSWER' that show the order of the letters in the word
The answer has to be 6 letters long then

Possible words:

    equity
    pequot
    piquet
    poetry
    pouter
    purity
    qwerty
    roquet
     -> torque
    towery
    troupe
     -> pyrite (fool's gold)

If it has a 'Q' or *P* that's extra good

I think 'PYRITE' is a good one

ANSWER -> 064853 -> PYRITE

ex. if the ending sum is 354068, then ANSWER will be spelled RESANW
A = 0
N = 6
S = 4
W = 8
E = 5
R = 3

W=1; N=9; S+E=11; A+R=8; S+R=E -> 2E = R + 11; E=7; R=3; S=4; A=5
f = 0; g = 8;

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
