Do one of those "Letter Adding" puzzles where each letter will be a specific number.

Then make the numbers be like 0-5 and, when put in order they spell a word.

Make the numbers be 0-9, and the letters below those numbers on a keyboard form the answer.
Where the sum in the puzzle has the letters 'ANSWER' that show the order of the letters in the word
The answer has to be 6 letters long then

Possible words:

    equity
    pequot
    piquet
    poetry
    pouter
    purity
    qwerty
    roquet
     -> torque
    towery
    troupe
     -> pyrite (fool's gold)

If it has a 'Q' or *P* that's extra good

I think 'PYRITE' is a good one

ANSWER -> 064853 -> PYRITE

ex. if the ending sum is 354068, then ANSWER will be spelled RESANW
A = 0
N = 6
S = 4
W = 8
E = 5
R = 3



              BELOW
            +NUMBER
            -------
             ANSWER

              XXXXX
            +XXXXXX
            -------


Nah, 'TORQUE' is a good one

ANSWER -> 594173 -> TORQUE
A = 5
N = 9
S = 4
W = 1
E = 7
R = 3

          EAfS       7504
        +NhRgE     +96387
        ------  -> ------
        WfRgNW     103891
        
        under h != 5

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
f W   R S A h E g N

S+E=11; A+R=8; E+h=10+R

Flavortext:
Mr. Suliga is offering extra credit to those able to solve this last problem on our homework.
He wants us to show our work since he says we won't need to guess, but also gave us the hint
that "H is not 5."

Each letter in this expression corresponds to a single digit, unique from the rest such that,
when the expression is translated into numbers, it creates a valid addition. There are no leading
zeros in any number. Once you have the answer, look under it!
