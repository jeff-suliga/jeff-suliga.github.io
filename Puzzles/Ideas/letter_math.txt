Do one of those "Letter Adding" puzzles where each letter will be a specific number.

Then make the numbers be like 0-5 and, when put in order they spell a word.

Make the numbers be 0-9, and the letters below those numbers on a keyboard form the answer.
Where the sum in the puzzle has the letters 'ANSWER' that show the order of the letters in the word
The answer has to be 6 letters long then

Possible words:

    equity
    pequot
    piquet
    poetry
    pouter
    purity
    qwerty
    roquet
     -> torque
    towery
    troupe
     -> pyrite (fool's gold)

If it has a 'Q' or *P* that's extra good

I think 'PYRITE' is a good one

ANSWER -> 064853 -> PYRITE

ex. if the ending sum is 354068, then ANSWER will be spelled RESANW
A = 0
N = 6
S = 4
W = 8
E = 5
R = 3

            +NUMBER

             ANSWER

              XXXXX
            +XXXXXX
            -------


Nah, 'TORQUE' is a good one

ANSWER -> 594173 -> TORQUE
A = 5
N = 9
S = 4
W = 1
E = 7
R = 3

S+E=11; A+R=8; E+h=10+R

Mr. Suliga is offering extra credit to those able to solve this last problem on our homework.
He tells us that each letter in the expression corresponds to a single digit, unique from the rest
such that, when translated into numbers, creates a valid addition expression. He always nags us to show
our work, since we shouldn't neeed to guess on these.

I snuck a peek at his answer sheet and all I could see through the mess of calculations was a big note saying
H != 5, that's got to be useful at some point. I couldn't see what was under the answer though...
