Do one of those "Letter Adding" puzzles where each letter will be a specific number.

Then make the numbers be like 0-5 and, when put in order they spell a word.

Make the numbers be 0-9, and the letters below those numbers on a keyboard form the answer.
Where the sum in the puzzle has the letters 'ANSWER' that show the order of the letters in the word
The answer has to be 6 letters long then

Possible words:

    equity
    pequot
    piquet
    poetry
    pouter
    purity
    qwerty
    roquet
     -> torque
    towery
    troupe
     -> pyrite (fool's gold)

If it has a 'Q' or *P* that's extra good

I think 'PYRITE' is a good one

ANSWER -> 064853 -> PYRITE

ex. if the ending sum is 354068, then ANSWER will be spelled RESANW
A = 0
N = 6
S = 4
W = 8
E = 5
R = 3

Nah, 'TORQUE' is a good one

ANSWER -> 594173 -> TORQUE
A = 5

Flavortext:
Mr. Suliga is offering extra credit to those able to solve this last problem on our homework.
He wants us to show our work since he says we won't need to guess, but also gave us the hint
that "H is not 5."

Text on page:
Each letter in this expression corresponds to a single digit, unique from the rest such that,
when the expression is translated into numbers, it creates a valid addition. There are no leading
zeros in any number. Once you have the answer, look under it!

        under h != 5

Since every digit 0-9 can only be held by a single letter, it will be helpful later on if we
maintain a list of values like the following, where we can mark off letters as we figure them out:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Another thing we notice about additions such as these is that, when we perform them by column, we may
have to 'carry a 1' into the next position. This can happen at any point, so let's add a row here just
to keep track of whether or not we are carrying a 1 from the previous column.

The first thing to notice when looking at this is that the sum has 6 place values, where the two added
terms only have 4 and 5. The only way for a 4-digit number and 5-digit number to add to a 6-digit number
is if the added numbers were large enough to carry a 1 to the sixth position. So we know 'W' is 1 here.

Further, since this 'N' here has nothing directly above it and we know we carry a 1 from this addition
into the sixth position, we also know we carry a 1 from the fifth position, which means this 'N' must be
a 9. This also tells us that 'F' must be 0 as 'N' must be turning from 9 to 10.

From here we can look at the first column - we know W is 1 and so S+E=11. S+E cannot be 1 since that would
require one of those numbers to be 1 and the other to be 0, and both of these values are already taken.
So S+E=11 which means we carry a 1 into the next column - which leads us to conclude that 'G' is 8. This
also tells us that there is no carry from this column into the next.

So here's what we have up to this point:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
F W             G N

And so we know that the rest of the six letters all have to be between 2 and 7 inclusive.

We already have S+E=11, and can construct a few more equations at this point. We know A+R=8 from this
column. A+R can't be 18 as that would require both of these letters to be 9. This means there is no
carry from this column.

Because of this and this carry here [fourth to fifth], we also have that E+H=R+10.

We are also told at the start that H != 5. These equations we have here are enough to finish the cryptarithm.

The easiest way to finish this step is to list out all of the numbers that each letter can be, and
begin to cross out which ones cannot happen, and look at what remains:

S E A R H
2 2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3 3 
4 4 4 4 4 
5 5 5 5 5 
6 6 6 6 6
7 7 7 7 7

Let's cross 5 out for H now

S E A R H
2 2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3 3 
4 4 4 4 4 
5 5 5 5 X 
6 6 6 6 6
7 7 7 7 7

Right away, we can cross out these, since they are the only digits 2-7 that can't make 11 with any other digit

S E A R H
X X 2 2 2
X X 3 3 3 
4 4 4 4 4 
5 5 5 5 X 
6 6 6 6 6
7 7 7 7 7

So we can see with S and E we either have a 4-7 pairing or a 5-6 pairing.

Another thing to notice is that, under A+R=8, we can cross these out. 4 because it would require the other
letter to also be 4, and 7 because it would require the other letter to be 1 which is already taken.

S E A R H
X X 2 2 2
X X 3 3 3 
4 4 X X 4 
5 5 5 5 X 
6 6 6 6 6
7 7 X X 7

So with A and R we either have 2-6 or 3-5

The last equation we haven't used yet is E+H=R+10. With the numbers we have here, we can see that E+H
can be at most 13, so R can't be more than 3. This also means A can't be less than 5

S E A R H
X X X 2 2
X X X 3 3 
4 4 X X 4 
5 5 5 X X 
6 6 6 X 6
7 7 X X 7

The next thing to notice is that, if we have a 5-6 pairing on S and E, this would remove all of the
possibilities for A, so neither S nor E and be 5 or 6

S E A R H
X X X 2 2
X X X 3 3 
4 4 X X 4 
X X 5 X X 
X X 6 X 6
7 7 X X 7

At this point we know E can't be 4, as E+H would be at most 11, and R can't be less than 2. So we
get that S and E are 4 and 7 respectively, and no other letters can be these

S E A R H
X X X 2 2
X X X 3 3 
4 X X X X 
X X 5 X X 
X X 6 X 6
X 7 X X X

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
F W     S     E G N

So now the equation E+H=10+R becomes H=3+R. Since H != 5, the only way this can occur is if H is 6
and R is 3. This also tells us that A is 5. This completes our cryptarithm puzzle, and we can check
that it is correct by plugging in our values back into our expression and verifying that the sum
is mathematically valid.

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
F W   R S A H E G N
