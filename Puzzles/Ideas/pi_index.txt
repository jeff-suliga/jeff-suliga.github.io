First 9 digits:

pi: 314159265 : 1234569

url is just '/pi' or '/sqrt3' or something
url is '/circumference/diameter' to reference pi

block puzzle solution reads out 'puzzle url: #### times ####' where # indexes the digit in the value of url
the product is the answer

'puzzle url: #### times ####'

do something with keyboard highlighing keys to make the message?

have flavortext in the boxes of a keyboard, something happens to identify different keys (raindrop, lighting up)
those keys spell out the url text

what does the keyboard outline show as?

city rooftops, something in the ocean, towels on a beach (doesn't make sense with rain animation)
**rain buckets on the ground**, cars in a big crash

keyboard image spaces per line:

13 + (backspace double)                 = 14
(tab double) + 13                       = 14
(caps double) + 11 + (enter double)     = 13
(shift double) + 10 + (shift double)    = 12
3 + (space) + 4                         = space

>> 53 and space

flavortext:

in this type of storm

when it rains, watching where
drops land is key to catching

the key to catching the most rain is to shift alternate types of buckets
