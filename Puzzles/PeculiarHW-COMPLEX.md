A couple things upfront,

- If you successfully solved this puzzle, well done! Tupper's Self-Referential Formula is one of my favorite pieces of math, and hopefully you've enjoyed seeing it in action and hopefully discovering how it works
- If you solved this puzzle by entering "-IMAGINARY" well done to you as well, but with a small amount of shade thrown your direction. The term "imaginary" used to describe a kind of number from which an entire *field* of research and study has evolved in my eyes, is criminal to the beauty and application of complex numbers. If you know me and my educational pursuits well enough, you understand why I cannot leave this unsaid. Either way, as above I hope you enjoyed playing around with the formula, and next time you encounter 'i' in a maths book or conversation, remember how useful and real they are!
- If you've come to this page to see the solution, I ask that you don't turn your brain off at the sight of math, the formula referenced here is truly a mathematical wonder!
