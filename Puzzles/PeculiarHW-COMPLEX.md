A couple things upfront,

- If you successfully solved this puzzle, well done! Tupper's Self-Referential Formula is one of my favorite pieces of math, and hopefully you've enjoyed seeing it in action and hopefully discovering how it works
- If you solved this puzzle by entering "-IMAGINARY" well done to you as well, but with a small amount of shade thrown your direction. The term "imaginary" used to describe a kind of number from which an entire *field* of research and study has evolved in my eyes, is criminal to the beauty and application of complex numbers. If you know me and my educational pursuits well enough, you understand why I cannot leave this unsaid. Either way, as above I hope you enjoyed playing around with the formula, and next time you encounter 'i' in a maths book or conversation, remember how useful and real they are!
- If you've come to this page to see the solution, I ask that you don't turn your brain off at the sight of math, the formula referenced here is truly a mathematical wonder!


**With this out of the way:**

When the player looks at this puzzle for the first time, they are presented with notebooks filled with confusing diagrams, large numbers, and a student's math homework sheet.

**Discovery 1:** In the midst of a confusing image, the player is clued in that they need only one number to solve any of the "problems" on the homework.

One of these problems is already solved on the left, denoted by the checkmark in the bottom corner. While confusing, the player can assume that the large 'k' number on the left is somehow associated to the image above it.

**Discovery 2:** 106 by 17

While I assume the image on the left sheet of paper is not familiar to most, one thing that comforts the player in searching around is the repeated use of the numbers 106 and 17. The questions on the notebook, the size of the matrix on the notepad, and the content on the calculator lead the player to believe that these numbers are significant to the solving of the puzzle. A quick google search of "106 by 17", the text in the calculator's matrix, leads the player to the fundamental resource to solving this Puzzle: *Tupper's Self-Referential Formula*. This should stick out to the player, given the student's homework we are agonizing over is one "Tupper Ware's" sheet, and the puzzle clue hints at "self-referencing shapes..."

*As an aside*, if you feel cheated out of a puzzle right now because you didn't know about the existence of this seemingly overspecific formula, I offer that this puzzle is completely solvable without the knowledge of the inner workings of this strange bit of math. It will become clear that the puzzle clue is true - to make it past this stage of the puzzle, all that is truly required is plugging in the numbers that are supplied. I suspect that many who may solve this puzzle don't fully grasp how the formula works, and I highly encourage the curious viewer to [watch this short and fun video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s5RFgd59ao) by [a very popular math channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/numberphile) and to expirement a bit with it yourself.

**Discovery 3:** Using the large numbers

A quick glance at any online source speaking about this topic most likely not only shows the example on the left sheet, solidifying the thought that the player is on the right track, but more importantly clues the player that the image shown on the left sheet is in fact a direct result of the number shown below it on the page. In fact, the player can input this number into one of many existing converters available online and verify this.

If the player does this at [this site](https://keelyhill.github.io/tuppers-formula/) as an example, using the first large number the following image shows up as expected:

At this point the player will realize they can do the same with the second large number they've been supplied. Doing so gives the following picture:

**Discovery 4:** The Discriminant

This above image is intentionally meant to make the player consider whether or not this milestone marks the end of the journey. The answer, after all, is meant to be a hyphenated extension of the puzzle's home URL. Submitting "DISCRIMINANT" as an answer selection leads the player through a small journey to stumble upon this image, leading them to realize that somewhere on the way, something deeper was at play.

![Tupper's Self-Referential Formula](../../images/PeculiarHW/NotQuite.png)

The choice of "discriminant" is very deliberate. Keeping with the math theme, many students in their earlier algebra classes learn that the [discriminant](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:quadratic-functions-equations/x2f8bb11595b61c86:quadratic-formula-a1/a/discriminant-review) relates to quadratic expressions - particularly it determines the kinds solutions any quadratic expression has. Treating the line in the image not as a hyphen, but as a negative sign, we now have "Negative Discriminant." When a quadratic expression has a negative discriminant, this means all of its solutions are **COMPLEX**, the answer to this puzzle.

closing note: dont feel bad, feel happy you learned something new

*As a closing note*, it may now be clear why I offer a substantial congratulations to those who solved this puzzle. It was a long journey from self-referential formulas to quadratic equations to complex numbers. But I suppose I would like those who see this to think of this not as a successful/failed attempt at a puzzle, but rather a challenge that required learning something new and seeing order from chaotic sources. So whether you got here by entering the correct answer or by clicking the link to the solution, I hope the feeling of learning is more satisfactory than what is expected from a normal puzzle.
