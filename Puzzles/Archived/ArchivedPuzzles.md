These are puzzles that I've made that I've taken off of my main page, either because they're too hard, too obscure, or I just feel they aren't good puzzles.

This is the first puzzle I made. I took it down because the background was way too busy and misleading, the polished version now exists on the main page as 
<a href="{{site.url}}/Puzzles/Spotlight">Spotlight</a>.

Warning, Spotlight and Detective share the same solution, so I recommend trying Spotlight first.

Caveman is a fun puzzle that explores different types of a specific way of encoding characters. I liked making this puzzle and I think it would be fun to solve, but it felt too straightforward and procedural. This puzzle was the inspiration for 
<a href="{{site.url}}/Puzzles/PoolTables">Pool Tables</a>.

Warning, Pool Tables and Caveman share a very particular theme. Viewing this will certainly give a big hint for Pool Tables, so I recommend trying Pool Tables first.
