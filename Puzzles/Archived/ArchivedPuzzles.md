### Archived Puzzles

These are puzzles that I've made that I've taken off of my main page, either because they're too hard, too obscure, or I just feel they aren't good puzzles.

Click on any below to try:

This is the first puzzle I made. I took it down because the background was way too busy and misleading, the polished version now exists on the main page as 
<a href="{{site.url}}/Puzzles/Spotlight">Spotlight</a>.

Warning, Spotlight and Detective share the same solution, so I recommend trying Spotlight first.

Caveman is a fun puzzle that explores different types of a specific way of encoding characters. I liked making this puzzle and I think it would be fun to solve, but it felt too straightforward and procedural. This puzzle was the inspiration for 
<a href="{{site.url}}/Puzzles/PoolTables">Pool Tables</a>.

Warning, Pool Tables and Caveman share a very particular theme. Viewing this will certainly give a big hint for Pool Tables, so I recommend trying Pool Tables first.

Fast Money has a really interesting concept to it. I wish I felt right about keeping it on the main page, but some of the key discoveries were just too obscure. At this point I haven't reworked a puzzle with this theme but I very likely will at some point.

A Peculiar Problem Set is a math related puzzle that I absolutely love. Unfortunately the main concept is wayy too obscure to include in a puzzle on my main page. There are some big hints in the image to guide the player towards an enlightening google search, but again this concept is not something that most people are familiar with. I may possibly start making concept-specific puzzles at some point (ex. this puzzle would fall into a "Math" category), in which this puzzle will absolutely make a return.

I encourage anyone who clicks on this puzzle and can't figure out what to do to look at the solution. I state this in the solution page, but this particular puzzle is one that should be viewed as a learning experience rather than failing/succeeding at a puzzle (in fact, I think all puzzles should be viewed this way but this one especially). So don't feel bad about looking at the solution for this one.

Also I accidentally messed up rows vs. columns in some matrix hints in the background which is embarassing
