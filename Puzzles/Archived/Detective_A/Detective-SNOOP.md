Starting off this puzzle, the player is presented with a dark-looking environment that's filled with various lights. They see 5 groupings of 4 letters, each containing scattered red dots inside.



**Discovery 1:** The puzzle clue hints that the player should be looking for areas that are left dark, rather than illuminated.

Hold this for later.



**Discovery 2:** The red objects in the background are present to guide the player into seeing the red dots as light sources, with light spilling out of all sides of them. The first grouping of letters spells out *GLOW* as an added hint.

In each letter, certain sections of the letter would then be aglow by the lights, and some portions may be left dark. For example, the 'X' would be fully illuminated (think cameras at the ends of two crossing hallways) while the right upright of the 'M' is left shadowed.



At this point, the player can focus only on the areas of the given letters that are left dark, traced in blue below:

Here it is clear that a pattern is emerging within each group of letters.

Looking closer at connecting these sections to one another, the player sneakily sees the letters **SNOOP** emerge, the answer to this puzzle.
