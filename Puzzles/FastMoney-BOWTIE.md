At first, this may look to the player like a normal "Family Feud" Fast Money scoreboard. At a closer look, however, one sees that the points don't fit within the game's rules. No one answer can have above 100% votes, and no one question have answers that sum up to above 100%. Furthermore, the *TOTAL* section is not actually the sum of the answer scores on the board.



**Discovery 1:** Each of the answers that share a row have words that begin with the same letter(s). Looking only at these letters we have:

<p align=center>

    <span style="font-weight:bold">I, CA, MG, CR, P</span>

</p>

<span style="font-weight:bold">ABCDE</span>


**Discovery 2:** A closer look at the clue and answers leads the player to notice intermittent capitalization, and that much of this puzzle has to do with food.

The *2000 TOTAL* and the *DV* capitalized in the clue point to the FDA's recommended Daily Values consisting of 2000 total Calories per day, found on the nutrition facts of nearly every food item sold in stores today.



**Discovery 3:** With a small hint of *Potassium*, one notices each of the previously found letters correspond to a chemical element, also having a recommended daily intake listed by the FDA. This information which can easily be found online is tabulated below:

| Letter | Element    | DV     |
|--------|------------|--------|
| I      | Iodine     | 150mcg |
| Ca     | Calcium    | 1300mg |
| Mg     | Magnesium  | 420mg  |
| Cr     | Chromium   | 35mcg  |
| P      | Phosphorus | 1250mg |

So now the player has the values given to them in the scoreboard associated with their respective elements, each having a recommended daily value.
However, on a Nutrition Facts label, these values are not given in mcg or mg, they are represented by their %DV, Percent Daily Value.

Finding the %DV of each of these to the nearest percent yields the following:

| Element    | %DV 1 | %DV 2 |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Iodine     | 6     | 16    |
| Calcium    | 1     | 1     |
| Magnesium  | 14    | 19    |
| Chromium   | 3     | 20    |
| Phosphorus | 25    | 1     |

Ex. For Chromium with DV 35mcg:

1mcg Cr = 2.9 %DV

7mcg Cr =  20 %DV

Spelling these out with A=1 B=2 ... gives: *FANCY PASTA*

Leading the player to the best dressed of pastas and this puzzle's solution, **BOWTIE**.
