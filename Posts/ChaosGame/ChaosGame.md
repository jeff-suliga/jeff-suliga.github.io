This post will be somewhat different from the rest in that, I'm not really going to explain much here. The point of this post is to showcase something that I first came across a long time ago, and decided to recreate in MS Paint for fun.

### The Motivation

`Test single ticks`

``Test double ticks``

```Test triple ticks```

<code>Test HTML code tag</code>

I first learned about this so-called "Chaos Game" (which is actually its standard name) from [this video](TODO) back in high school. I thought it was super cool, but I haven't really thought about it or seen it anywhere since then.

Fast-forward 5 years and I'm learning and playing around with ```pyautogui```, a python library that lets me program mouse and keyboard inputs, just because I was curious to see how I could do that. I didn't want to test my programs by just letting it click all over my screen, so I opened up Microsoft Paint - probably the most basic and primitive window I can use to click and track where I'm sending my mouse to go via turtle-esque function calls.

As I'm getting bored with just ```moveTo()``` and ```click()```, I remember this one video I saw a long time ago that describes a game using just those two functionalities to create amazing fractal designs out of randomness - the Chaos Game.

I code up a pretty basic version of this game to be played within my MS Paint window and suddenly become engrossed with toying around with the rules and seeing what I get.

### The Game

The Chaos Game is very simple. The most well-known result uses the following rules:

<p><pre>        </pre>Test tabs with pre</p>

<p><pre>&#9</pre>Test tab with pre and unicode</p>

<p>&#9 Test indent with just unicode</p>
