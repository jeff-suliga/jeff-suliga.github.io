My goal for this post is to provide a more intuitive and staisfying way to understand solve problems with complex numbers. If solving for z in expressions such as

\\(z=i^{n}, n \in \mathbb{Z};\quad\\) or \\(z=re^{i\theta};\quad\\) or even better \\(z=\sqrt{4(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})}\\)

leave you wondering where to even start trying to evaluate - good! By the end of this I hope that you will have the tools you need to evaluate these, and be able to explain them to others.
