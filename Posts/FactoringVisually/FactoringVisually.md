My first semester sophomore year, I took a technical writing course which focused on effective communication, with an emphasis on workplace communication between coworkers, team members, supervisors/bosses, etc. For the final project of this class, we were asked to compile a "PechaKucha Presentation" video. The presentation's guidelines were loose, I could choose any topic I wanted to present on and create at least 20 slides, each with some visual aid, to practice giving presentations without relying on much textual support on the screen.

The idea of this assignment was for us students to "learn how to present material concisely and quickly," and we were told to strive to keep our entire compilation around 6-8 minutes. So please enjoy my 23-minute submission on a different way to look at factoring that hopefully clears up concepts that many have been exposed to in a non-intuitive way.
