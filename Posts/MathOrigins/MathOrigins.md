Grant quote at the end of bertrand's paradox video -> "People expect math to do more than it does..."

It was my junior year of high school when I was first faced with this question, and at this point my formal math education extended through integral calculus. I was hanging out with my math teacher in the time before first period started one day, when Mr. Martin asked me something along the lines of this question:

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"You ever feel like we might discover something that breaks math?"</em></p>

I remember at the time quickly responding, defending the concreteness of math's origins. I said "it works way too well" and we therefore could not make any discoveries that contradict what we've already found out about the world. 17 year old me would have said without hesitation that math is entirely discovered as opposed to invented - for how could a science that is so descriptive of our natural world, so useful and present in just about all areas of life, and "works so well" be one that is foundationally manufactured by human thought?

As I have advanced in my formal math education and self study I have grown to see the naivety in this stance. I look back on recent years in school as my math study has become more abstract and fundamental and notice just how many areas of even basic middle/high school mathematics have been shaped by a fabricated structure designed to fit our discoveries into a defined set of rules to play by. If Mr. Martin were to ask me this question again now, I would say absolutely! Without a doubt there will absolutely be some new discovery or way of thought that challenges the current state of mathematical thinking. In fact, it has happened many times!

In this post I will introduce this commonly-asked question and speak to why I now lean more towards saying that math is invented, rather than discovered.

A basis for my response in grade school was due to the fact that I could look around and see math around me in the physical world. At the most fundamental level of counting how many watermelons Johnny bought from the store, math is present. In studying the algebraic relationship between instantaneous rates of change and continuous accumulation (differentiation vs integration), math's seeming completeness is found. All around us, math can be used to identify, describe, and predict attributes of the physical world. **Because that's what it's designed to do.**

Math is designed to describe the physical world, and when it doesn't, we make more rules for it to do so. When we find a problem that is unsolvable using the current state of mathematical thinking, we extend the base from which all math is contained. This would be an example of math-breaking discovery. Examples of this throughout history could be: negative numbers, non-integral exponents, infinity, complex numbers, analytic continuation, the gamma function and fractional calculus, quaternion math, the hyperreal system.

Talk about axiomatic structure

We're going to camp out on a couple of these examples for a little bit. First, lets talk about imaginary numbers.

Imaginary numbers

Talk about extending exponents to include fractions/decimals

Godel's incompleteness theorem

Talk about "discovering backwards":

Linear Algebra "dot product" thing being defined to align with pythagorean theorem
