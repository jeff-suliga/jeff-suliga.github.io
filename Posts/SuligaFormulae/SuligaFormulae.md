This post will showcase two different formulas that I came up with in my latter years of high school.

\\[\int\\_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{ax^{2}+bx+c} \space dx = \\]

\\[\lim\\_{n \to \infty} e^{\frac{b^{2}}{4a}}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}(e^{an} - 1)}\\]

[The first](#suliga-formula-1), coined by my friends as *The Suliga Theorem* (which doesn't even make sense), is a generalization of a discovery first popularized by and named after one of history's smartest minds, Carl Friedrich Gauss.
